# LISTED_AI_TRANSLATOR

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to use the translate library to translate a given English text (in this case, the content of the article_en variable) into Hindi. It's a simple example of using the library to perform language translation.

If you want to modify this code to keep some words in English while translating others to Hindi, you can refer to the previous code example I provided in a previous response.
